Atlas Harvest Resource list
Strongly recommend these changes only be used from a BASE Harvest of 1.  Base harvest increase will multiply these changes as well
so a base harvest of x5 plus a specific harvest item of x5 is x10.  High gather rates adversely affect server performance with 
animal harvesters like elephants, bears, giraffes etc.
Add selected lines to your defaultgame.ini file Located in  \ShooterGame\Config\defaultgame.ini
Adjust multiplier as needed.  
I also don't recommend you add the ENTIRE list just pick which ones to buff or nerf.

This list is a work in progress there may be typos or things may not work correctly.  
ALWAYS backup your work before implementing changes.  Please feel free to share and comment.  

If you want to give me credit feel free but it is not necessary.
